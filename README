README

This is a bot for /r/hockey to aggregate the top posts of each hockey subreddit (e.g. /r/Canucks, /r/Habs) and condense them into a single post.

TODO:
*Add proper bot functionality so it can run itself, right now it is just a script that must be manually operated.
*Edit output formatting, prettify it.
*Add the option to output data as a sidebar friendly list.
*Generalize the script so that it could run for other subreddits too.
